This is my TJ-BOTðŸ¤– . 
languages used javascript .[app.js,.env].
This is the program a simple robot (TJBot) to move its arm, recognize objects, flash a light, speak, and more.
You can build simple apps to control TJBot by using Node.js or Node-RED. 
If you don't want to purchase the TJBot, you can use a simulator instead.

I used artificial intelligence services (Watson) to program the robot to recognize objects and color, 
translate speech to text, recognize and translate languages, and analyze emotional tones in text.
